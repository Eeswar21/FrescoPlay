Create an inventory file named myhosts
vi myhosts

Add host01 as the host name under the group [group1] where host1 should be the ansible ubuntu ssh user.
[group1]
host01 ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu

Now, stop a sudo service using state argument
ansible group1 -i ./myhosts -m service -a "name=sudo state=stopped"

Also, start a sudo service using state argument
ansible group1 -i ./myhosts -m service -a "name=sudo state=started"

Write an ansible command to create a directory on remote host name myRemoteFolder
ansible host01 -i ./myhosts -m file -a "dest=myRemoteFolder state=directory"

Write an ansible command to check the list of files and folders on remote host
ansible host01 -i ./myhosts -m shell -a "ls"
